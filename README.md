## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop an agent that can play Tetris. The standard **Tetris** is a stochastic, open-end board game.

**Reinforcement Learning** refers to goal-oriented algorithms, which learns how to maximize along a specific dimension over many steps; in this case, maximize the points won in a game of Tetris over many moves. Like how humans learn to achieve better score, through multiple interaction with the Tetris game environment, Reinforcement learning is just a computational approach of learning from action.

## Entry Six
**Recess Week | 1st October 2018**

> Progress on hold during Recess Week due to CZ3004 Multidisciplinary Design Project.

Attempted to continue research on other possible Tetris game environment as there is issues with the previous implementation.

**_Possible Tetris Game Environment_**
- Made using [Text Game Maker JS](https://www.a-mean-blog.com/en/blog/Text-Game-Maker-JS/Games/Tetris)
- Made using [Blockrain JS](http://aerolab.github.io/blockrain.js/)

> Updated on 8th October 2018

## Entry Five
**Week 7 | 24th September 2018**

Third meeting and discussion with Prof. Bresson. Updated Prog. Bresson on current progress.

Plans of implementating Tetris game environment using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Allow ease of sharing/distribution of the Tetris game for collection of gameplay data. Using GitHub to host the Tetris game environment.

**_Suggestions Obtained During Meeting_**
- Collection of game data - Every environment state, actions performed and reward gain
- Collection of game data from both **Humans** and **Agents**
- Training of two **Agents** - One learning from scratch and the other with boost from Human gameplay data

## Entry Four
**Week 6 | 17th September 2018**

Followed a tutorial on building a [grid](http://slavchoslavchev.com/tutorials/building-a-grid-matrix-in-javascript/) (matrix) in JavaScript. In this tutorial, a grid (a.k.a. matrix) using JavaScript is implemented. This grid will be the based when building the Tetris game environment. Check out the grid [here](https://jcodesh.github.io/Projects/Grid%20Matrix/index.html).

Continued on a separate tutorial to build the Tetris game environment - Implementing the Tetris Shape, Adding movement and rotation to the Tetris Shape.

## Entry Three
**Week 5 | 10th September 2018**

Second meeting and discussion with Prof. Bresson. Updated [Project Plan](https://jcodesh.github.io/Documentations/Final%20Year%20Project%20Plan%20[20180910].pdf) with timeline.

Will research and read up on current implementation of Tetris API. Usage of API will improved efficiency as there are already workable implementation of Tetris game environment.

> Updated on 10th September 2018

## Entry Two
**Week 4 | 3rd September 2018**

Continued on the [Python Programming](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) Course Syllabus.

Read up on [Deep Reinforcement Learning: Pong from Pixels](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/).

Research on current implementation of building a Tetris game environment.

> Updated on 3rd September 2018

## Entry One
**Week 3 | 27th August 2018**

First meeting and discussion with Prof. Bresson to understand about project objective and initial objectives and milestones for the project. Project Plan can be found [here](https://jcodesh.github.io/Documentations/Final%20Year%20Project%20Plan%20[20180910].pdf).

Read up on [Python Programming](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python). Decided to implement this project in python because it is versatile and powerful and it is becoming the most popular programming language used by software engineers, analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers alike.
